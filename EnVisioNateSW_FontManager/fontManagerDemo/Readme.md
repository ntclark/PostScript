
# Understanding the EnVisioNateSW FontManager system with additional help with the EnVisioNateSW Renderer 

This project will help you see how the FontManager works and how you might utilize it in your own 
software projects.

At one level, the FontManager is very simple to use, you should be able to take the solution or projects from it from this
repository and build the artifacts you'll need to render text.

**Note:** Please remember that the font manager is about rendering glyphs on a screen (window in your application), on 
bitmaps, or on your printer. Specifically, it does not help you in laying out text, with, for example, tools to help in 
kerning or justification. However, it does offer everything about font (glyph) metrics with which you can implement those
techniques yourself, if that is important for your application.
