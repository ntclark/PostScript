
# A simple example using the PostScriptInterpreter

This is a very simple console application that shows how your application can 
initiate the PostScript Interpreter object, send it some PostScript code, and then,
through a connected events interface, pass to your application the location and 
content of all of the text in that PostScript.

The example could be pressed into use right away as a tool to detect certain
text or data in a document, even including the position in the document of that text.

Free of charge, you've got out of the box a content detection tool. Connect it up 
with the CursiVision Print Driver, and you could use this tool for any document
whatsoever, no matter the "type", or extension.

For more on this possibility, and to obtain a free PostScript print driver suitable for this purpose, go [here](.../PostScriptInterpreter/#Note).
