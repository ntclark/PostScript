# CV Postscript Converter

# This project is not used at this point and does not build

"CV" is for CursiVision

This project is just a COM (Component Object Model) stub intended for future use 
to convert incoming '.ps files (prolly from the MS pscript5.dll which in turn is probably from a custom print driver) 
into '.PDF files ( Or, to render the ps to the screen or printer using the PostScriptInterpreter COM object)

The project contains my simple COM object boilerplate. For a complex (hostable) COM object, see the [PostScriptInterpreter](../PostScriptInterpreter) project as the object, and the [HostPostcript](../HostPostscript) project as a sample host
