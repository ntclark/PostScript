# CV Postscript Converter

"CV" is for CursiVision

This project is currently just a COM (Component Object Model) stub intended for future use 
to convert incoming '.ps files (prolly from the MS pscript5.dll which in turn is probably from a custom print driver) 
into '.PDF files ( Or, to render the ps to the screen or printer using the PostscriptGen2 COM object)

The project contains my simple COM object boilerplate. For a complex (hostable) COM object, see the [PostScriptGen2](../PostScript) project as the object, and the [ParsePostcript](../ParsePostscript) project as a sample host
